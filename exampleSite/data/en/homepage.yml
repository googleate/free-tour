    content: We did the Marbella city center tour with Santiago. We were lucky that
      the other party on the tour had cancelled so we had a private tour!! Santiago
      was extremely knowledgable and gave us lot of detail and information on each
      place and also bits and pieces of the in-between that tied the places together
      into a whole story! Spent a good amount of time with us and also gave us good
      local tips for food, shops and such. We would highly recommend this tour.

    content: We had a fantastic tour led by Lisa and due to COVID it was just the
      three of us. We've been to Marbella many times and so it was wonderful to learn
      more about the history of the city and the buildings we love so much. Lisa was
      extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommended!
